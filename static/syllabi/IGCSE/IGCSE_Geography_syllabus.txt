The subject content is arranged into the three themes:
•

Population and settlement

•

The natural environment

•

Economic development.

The content listed is exhaustive except where the word ‘including’ is used. Where ‘including’ is used,
candidates must study everything in the list but may also study other relevant aspects. For example:
•

in Topic 2.3, all the coastal landforms you must cover are listed

•

in Topic 2.5, where ‘including’ is used, you may choose to introduce other climatic characteristics as well as
the ones listed.

Resources
Some questions in all the written papers are based on resource material, such as photographs, map extracts,
satellite images, drawings, diagrams, graphs, text extracts, statistics and tables of data.
To meet the aims of an international syllabus and examination, resource materials come from various areas of
the world. Candidates may not be familiar with the world areas used in the resources. The questions do not
require specific regional knowledge. The resources are designed to prompt candidates to use the general
principles they have studied.
The units used in all resources and papers are:
•

metres and kilometres for height and distance

•

degrees centigrade for temperature.

Questions in all papers may include references to latitude or longitude.

Case studies
Where a case study is specified in a topic, teachers should choose a suitable example to illustrate the subject
content. For example, Topic 1.6 requires a case study of an urban area. The case study can be from anywhere
in the world but it must illustrate all the content listed under Topic 1.6.
You can choose more than one case study for a topic. For example, for Topic 1.6 you could choose Settlement X
for a case study on land use and Settlement Y for a case study on urban problems.
You can also use the same case study for more than one topic as long as it is suitable for the subject content.
