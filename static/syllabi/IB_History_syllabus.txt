IB History Syllabus + Topics


The IB History syllabus consists of two sections (there's a third section if you're an HL student): the Prescribed Subject, World History topics, and the Regional topics (HL only). What makes the IB History syllabus so unique is that within each section, your teacher has the flexibility to choose which specific historical topics you'll focus on during lessons and hence the questions you will be answering on your exams.

The only requirement from the IB is that the selected case studies for each topic must come from different regions (the IB divided the world into four regions: Asia and Oceania, the Americas, Europe, and Africa).
