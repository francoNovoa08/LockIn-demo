IB Chemistry Syllabus + Topics


The IB Chemistry syllabus is made up of two overarching themes â€“ Structure and Reactivity. Each of these themes consists of a variety of topics. 



In the 2025 Chemistry syllabus, only one topic is exclusive to Higher Level (HL) students. Apart from that, HL and Standard Level (SL) students cover the same topics, with HL students delving into them in greater depth.





Structure 1: Models of the particulate nature of matter


Introduction to the particulate nature of matter 
The nuclear atom
Electron configurations
Couting particles by mass: The mole
Ideal gases

Reactivity 1: What drives chemical reactions?


Measuring enthalpy changes 
Energy cycles in reactions
Energy from fuels
Entropy and spontaneity (HL only)

Structure 2: Models of bonding and structure


The ionic model 
The covalent model
The metallic model
From models to materials 

Reactivity 2: How much, how fast and how far?


How much? The amount of chemical change
How fast? The rate of chemical change
How far? The extent of chemical change

Structure 3: Classifiction of matter


The periodic table: Classification of metals 
Functional groups: Classification of organic compounds

Reactivity 3: What are the mechanisms of chemical change?


Proton transfer reactions
Electron transfer reactions
Electron sharing reactions
Electron-pair sharing reactions
