Structure of the IB Sports, Exercise and Health Science Course
The IB Sports, Exercise and Health Science (SEHS) course is available at both Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL). It is a two-year course that includes theoretical and practical components, allowing students to explore various aspects of human performance and health within the context of sport and exercise.

The course combines core topics, optional topics, practical investigations, and a Group 4 project, which encourages collaboration across different science disciplines. Students are assessed through external exams and an Internal Assessment (IA), with a focus on applying scientific methods to real-world scenarios.

The time commitment for the course differs between SL and HL:

Standard Level (SL) requires 150 teaching hours.
Higher Level (HL) requires 240 teaching hours.
The course includes a balance of theory-based learning and hands-on practical work, ensuring students gain a holistic understanding of the subject.

Key Components of the Course
Component	Standard Level (SL)	Higher Level (HL)	Description
Core Topics	80 hours	130 hours	Covers fundamental topics related to human anatomy, exercise physiology, biomechanics, and more.
Additional Topics	N/A	50 hours	HL students explore additional topics in greater depth to build a more advanced understanding of the subject.
Options	30 hours	50 hours	Students choose two options to study in-depth, such as optimising performance, psychology of sport, physical activity and health, or nutrition.
Practical Work	40 hours	60 hours	Includes lab work, fieldwork, and practical investigations to apply theoretical knowledge.

‍

The course also places emphasis on developing critical thinking, research skills, and an understanding of the ethical implications of sports science in a global context. Both SL and HL students engage in practical and theoretical learning, but HL students are required to study additional content and complete more extensive assessments.

The structure of skeletal muscle fibres, including the microscopic components (sarcomeres, actin, and myosin)
The role of connective tissue in muscle contraction and movement
The types of muscle contractions, including isotonic, isometric, and isokinetic movements
The function of the respiratory muscles during ventilation
Topic 8: The Endocrine System
This topic introduces students to the role of hormones in regulating body functions, particularly during exercise. It includes:

The functions of key endocrine glands such as the adrenal gland, pancreas, and pituitary gland
The role of hormones like adrenaline, cortisol, and insulin in exercise metabolism
The effects of exercise on hormonal balance and metabolic regulation
Topic 9: Fatigue
This topic examines the causes and effects of fatigue during exercise and how the body recovers. Students learn about:

The physiological and psychological causes of fatigue
The difference between central and peripheral fatigue
Recovery strategies to reduce fatigue and enhance performance
How fatigue differs across various types of exercise (e.g., endurance vs. sprinting)
Topic 10: Friction and Drag
This biomechanics topic explores the forces that affect movement through different environments. Key concepts include:

Friction in sporting contexts, such as running, cycling, and skiing
The impact of drag forces in air and water, including aerodynamics and hydrodynamics
Ways to reduce drag to improve performance, such as equipment design and body positioning
Topic 11: Skill Acquisition and Analysis
This topic focuses on the cognitive processes involved in learning and performing skills in sports. Students explore:

Stages of learning and how athletes progress from beginners to experts
Types of feedback (intrinsic, extrinsic) and how feedback can improve performance
The role of motivation, anxiety, and arousal in performance
Strategies for skill acquisition, including practice methods and coaching techniques
